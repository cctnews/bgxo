If ice poem, it is his own personality, especially his lights and other series of poems.
In march, he show yourself in the spring "melancholy" : in March, the light is behind/sun beat dawn and stressed eight hundred qinchuan/a song in the bridge on the misty rain to/into/hurt my eyes......
Read this poem, have a kind of grief reverberate in the heart, let a person mind to flat, suprised the poetry, I can't afford not to read a few times.
Read if ice "image" is the feeling of a kind of stirring, arrived in the heart a kind of pleasure.
His performance this connotation rich imagery:...
A may flowers/clean/body in the rain washed wash/tell me once again had the spring/a hospital open the window, let the shadow of the clouds and rain in the blessing of health/landed in southern paddy fields/a girl walked across the garden/tears away/light and flame/has left the love in the spring.
It's thinking and emotion of cover, have far more than the poem itself, so to speak.
It reminds me of this: the real good poetry, is naturally grow on their own land, they absorb nutrients and moisture from the soil, sunlight on fields, from the bottom of the swaying their own rhythm.
This is also I read if ice the feeling of the poem.
If ice in their emotional world, free to stretch the tentacles of the poem.
